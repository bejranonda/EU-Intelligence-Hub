## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

### Immediate Production Steps
1. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Update production environment variables
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   # Configure actual production credentials
   nano .env.production
   ```

2. **Deploy with SSL**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh production
   ./setup-ssl.sh yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   curl -f https://yourdomain.com/health
   curl -f https://yourdomain.com/api/status
   ```

### Environment Requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Ubuntu 24 LTS with Docker Compose v2.40.0+
- **Resources**: 4GB RAM minimum, 10GB disk space
- **External Services**: Google Gemini API key required
- **Domains**: SSL certificate will be auto-provisioned via Let's Encrypt

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance & Scalability

### Current Capabilities
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for database queries
- **Semantic Search**: Vector similarity search performing optimally
- **Background Processing**: Celery queue handling scheduled tasks efficiently
- **Concurrent Users**: Designed for 100+ concurrent sessions

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: Consider PostgreSQL read replicas for high traffic
- **Redis**: Memory usage scales with user activity and queue size  
- **API Rate Limits**: Configurable (currently set to 60 requests/minute)

---

## ðŸ”„ Ongoing Operations

### Monitoring Recommendations
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of `/health` endpoint
- **Log Analysis**: Monitor Celery task execution logs
- **Resource Usage**: Track database connections and memory usage
- **API Performance**: Monitor response times and error rates

### Maintenance Tasks
- **Database Backups**: Implement automated daily backups
- **SSL Renewal**: Let's Encrypt certificates auto-renew
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular security patches for AI libraries
- **Performance Tuning**: Monitor and optimize based on usage patterns
