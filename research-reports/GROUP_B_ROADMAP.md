### **4.3 Feature Impact & Priority Matrix**

| Feature | Impact (1-10) | Effort (1-10) | Priority | Revenue Impact | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **OAuth Authentication** | 10 | 5 | P0 | Enabler | Can't monetize without login |
| **Stripe Billing** | 10 | 6 | P0 | $50K MRR | Core revenue system |
| **Email Alerts** | 9 | 4 | P0 | +20% retention | #1 user request |
| **CSV Export** | 8 | 2 | P0 | Enabler | Required for academics |
| **2-Year Historical Data** | 8 | 7 | P0 | Tier differentiation | Justifies Business tier |
| **API Access** | 9 | 5 | P0 | $50K MRR | Opens developer segment |
| **Team Collaboration** | 7 | 6 | P1 | +15% conversion | Agencies need multi-user |
| **White-Label Export** | 6 | 3 | P1 | $2.4K MRR | Competitive edge |
| **Mobile PWA** | 7 | 8 | P1 | +10% engagement | Convenience, not critical |
| **GraphRAG** | 8 | 9 | P1 | Future-proofing | 12-18 month moat |
| **SSO/SAML** | 9 | 7 | P1 | $50K ARR (Enterprise) | Enterprise blocker |
| **Predictive Analytics** | 6 | 8 | P2 | Differentiation | Cool, not essential |

## 4.4 Recommended MVP (Minimum Viable Value)

### **For First 100 Paying Customers**

**Include:**
1. [P0] OAuth + Stripe = Payment system
2. [P0] Email alerts = Engagement driver
3. [P0] CSV export = Academic requirement
4. [P0] 90-day history (Pro), 2-year (Business) = Tier differentiation
5. [P0] API with 10K calls/month = Developer access

**Exclude (Add Later):**
- Team collaboration (can share account initially)
- White-label (manual PDF exports work)
- Mobile PWA (mobile web sufficient)
- GraphRAG (current vector search adequate)
- SSO/SAML (HTTP Basic Auth okay for first enterprise pilot)

**Rationale**: **Focus on revenue-generating features only.** Each P0 feature directly enables monetization or prevents churn. P1+ features are growth optimizations, not blockers.
