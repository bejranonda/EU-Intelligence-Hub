## üî¥ What YOU Need to Do (3 Steps)

Your error was:
```
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

### Step 1: Fix Docker Permissions (1 minute)

```bash
sudo bash fix-docker-permissions.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ User payas added to docker group successfully!

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: You MUST log out and log back in
```

### Step 2: Log Out and Log Back In (CRITICAL!)

**This is NOT optional!** Docker group membership only takes effect after logging in again.

**Choose ONE:**

**Option A**: Close and reopen terminal
```bash
exit
# Then open new terminal
```

**Option B**: Restart computer (most reliable)
```bash
sudo reboot
```

**Option C**: Try this (may not work)
```bash
newgrp docker
```

### Step 3: Verify and Continue (30 seconds)

After logging back in:

```bash
# Test docker works
docker ps
# Should show empty list with NO error

# If that works, run setup
./setup.sh
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Know It Worked

### Before Fix:
```bash
$ docker ps
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

### After Fix (and logging out/in):
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

**Empty list = Success!** Now you can run `./setup.sh`
